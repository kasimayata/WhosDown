# WhosDown

## What it is

WhosDown is an open-source Windows 10 client for WhatsApp.  More specifically, it's a wrapper for WhatsApp Web.

## Why would I want to use this?

WhosDown provides several advantages over just using web.whatsapp.com in your browser.

1. Windows Action Center notifications on unread messages.
2. Minimal window chrome.
3. A WhatsApp-like color theme.
4. Can easily be pinned to taskbar or start menu.

## I have a problem or idea!

Great!  [Create an issue](https://github.com/CamSoper/WhosDown/issues), or, better yet, fork the project and contribute!  I'm not much of an app developer (I'm more of a web guy, and I'm way out of my element with XAML...  I didn't even *attempt* MVVM!) so I appreciate whatever you want to add.
